## Topic 2: Alternative Credit Scoring in South Africa

---

## 📋 Topic Overview

Roughly one in three South African adults is considered "unscorable" by traditional credit bureaus. This means they either have no credit history or their credit file is too "thin" (lacking enough repayment data) for the bureau models to generate a reliable risk score. Without a score, these individuals are often automatically excluded from formal lending, regardless of their actual ability or willingness to repay.

This exclusion creates a financial access paradox: to get credit, one needs a credit history — but to build a credit history, one first needs access to credit. The result is that millions of South Africans, including informal workers, gig economy participants, and low-income households, are locked out of affordable credit options and pushed toward costly informal or unsecured products.

Alternative credit scoring offers a potential solution. By drawing on non-traditional data sources — such as mobile usage, digital wallet transactions, retail loyalty data, and open banking APIs — and pairing these with more flexible modelling techniques, lenders can create a more complete picture of a borrower's financial profile. The recent rise in Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) represents an innovation which leverages alternative credit scoring.

However, alternative scoring also introduces new challenges and trade-offs. More complex models raise questions around explainability and governance, and the use of sensitive behavioural data amplifies concerns about privacy, consent, and data custodianship. Evidence shows that even well-designed machine learning systems can unintentionally embed or amplify algorithmic bias, shifting risk classifications in ways that disadvantage certain groups.

## 🔍 Research Focus

This dissertation asks you to explore how an alternative credit scoring system could be responsibly designed for South Africa. It invites an analysis of the technical, regulatory, and ethical dimensions of such a system, including the trade-offs between simplicity and complexity, innovation and privacy, inclusion and profitability.

### Key Points of Discussion

#### Shortcomings of traditional credit scoring
- How do bureau-based models work, and why do they exclude thin and no-file consumers

#### Alternative data sources and custodianship
- What data exists in South Africa that could be used to supplement credit repayment information? E.g. mobile data, utility payments etc.
- How can this data be shared? How should it be stored? Centralised or decentralised? What are the privacy and security risks?

#### Credit scoring algorithmic design trade-offs
- What are some of the trade-offs when considering simple (e.g. linear and logistic regression) vs more complex (e.g gradient boosting, neural nets) predictive algorithms for credit scoring?
- Are there any concerns related to algorithmic bias?

### Approach Options

This dissertation topic is open-ended. Examples of (or combinations of) ways to approach this:

- **System Design and Architecture**: Propose and describe a conceptual design for an alternative credit scoring system, detailing data flows, governance arrangements, model components, and decision-making processes.
- **Algorithmic Focus**: Explore algorithmic approaches in greater depth, discussing how different modelling techniques would perform in this context and what the trade-offs are between accuracy, explainability, and fairness.
- **Regulatory Policy Analysis**: Conduct a review of the legal and regulatory frameworks (e.g., NCA, POPIA) that shape the feasibility of alternative credit scoring, and assess how governance, consumer protection, and fairness requirements could be met.
- **Economic Policy Analysis**: Analyse the incentives facing lenders, borrowers, regulators, and data custodians. Consider externalities, distributional effects, and questions of fairness and accountability.
